Crystal Sonification
====================

This Project is about crystal growth sonification. 
Pictures of crystalgrowth are analysed in Processing. Then I send the image data via the Open Sound Control Protocol to SuperCollider which creates the sound based on the crystal growth images.

Requirements:
-------------
Download these two programms. I shot the images with a Raspberry Pi.
